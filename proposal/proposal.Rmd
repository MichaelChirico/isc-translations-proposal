# The proposal

Growing and sustaining high-quality multi-lingual translations for R

## Overview

This project will provide a better formalization of translation procedures to be more
sustainable and more scalable. In the process, it will broaden the inclusivity of R by
growing the sub-community of R users comfortable producing translations and extending
the reach of the R project to more non-English audiences.
