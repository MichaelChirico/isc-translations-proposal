# Requirements

The proposed project is basically labor-intensive. It requires time input
in several aspects:
 - Building translation tooling, i.e., `potools`
 - Designing the useR! workshop
 - Reviewing existing translations
 - Researching translation best practices
 - Soliciting and vetting new and/or updated translations
 - Translation itself
 
The first two of these would basically be done by me.
Review and research could be done with additional headcount
Work involving R translations ultimately needs an R Core member with commit rights;
solicitation could be done on r-project.org and/or through word-of-mouth.
Translation of course requires native speakers also very comfortable with English.


## Tools & Tech

`potools` will be the primary tool for this project.
