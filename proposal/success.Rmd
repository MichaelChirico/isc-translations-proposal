# Success

## Definition of done

Here are some KRs for the concrete objectives laid out in the overview:

 - `potools` is on CRAN and works for C-level translations
 - The translations workshop at useR! 2021 is a success
 - R-devel translation readiness: someone signs off on having completed this (?)
 - Best practices: a document with the summary & review
 - R translation ecosystem: Documentation on r-project.org delineating the new process
 - New translations: Translations for Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Indonesian, and Urdu

## Measuring success

One clear milestone will be the useR! workshop. Attendance and feedback there
will be good indicators of progress.

## Future work

`potools` has some pending feature requests that would greatly enrich the translating experience,
such as some functionality to identify similar messages that are candidates for merging.

## Key risks

The goal to get new translations relies on community involvement which ultimately can't be guaranteed.
